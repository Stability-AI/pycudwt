TODO LIST

- Refactoring :
    - Create a structure containing informations on WT. Used by Wavelets() class, but also by common functions (to avoid kilometers-long functions signature)
    - Not all files in same folder (test, src, doc, build)
    - Remove useless files (profiling) and put i/o in "test"
    - No more #include "*.cu" !
- TYPE template to support both double and simple precision
- Modify inverse haar (and related) to avoid extra memcpy
- ISWT : only appcoeffs at last scale are used (cf Matlab) : Don't store the other appcoeffs
- More threshold types
- Compute norm related to threshold (eg. soft/L1, group-lasso, etc)
- User-defined target CUDA device
- Documentation/Howtos
